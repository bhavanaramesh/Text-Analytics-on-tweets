# Text-Analytics-on-tweets
This repository is dedicated for Text and Context mining using twitter data
These programs holds a bunch of algorithms used for Text and Content mining. I use tweets pulled from twitter for user-user and word-word analysis. Below are the various algos used to mine context.
1. Pull request for gathering data from twitter
2. Data cleaning (especially tweets)
3. Sentiment analysis using AFINN, BING, NRC
4. K-means clustering (2,3,5,15,30 clusters) & visualization 
5. Hierarchical clustering & dendogram visualization
6. Silhouette for finding optimal cluster size
7. Elbow method for finding optimal cluster size
8. GAP statistics for finding optimal cluster size
9. Word: Newtwork graph 
10. Identify & plot frequent terms
11. Word cloud for visualization 
12. Topic Modelling 
13. Modularity - using Grivan-Newman, fast greedy, walk trap and Louvain algorithms
14. Spectral algorithm
